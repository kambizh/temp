Do I need to create a StressController class annotated with @Profile("stress-controller") so that it only loads when this Spring profile is active, and then activate the stress-controller profile (for example, via SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=stress-controller or in application.yaml) to ensure the controller is instantiated and starts watching Stress CRs, or can I simply add an entry for Stress in the controllers.yaml file so that it is created dynamically without writing a dedicated Java controller class?
