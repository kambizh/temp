Do I need to both create a StressController class annotated with @Profile("stress-controller") so that it is instantiated only when the stress-controller Spring profile is active, and also add a corresponding stress entry in the controllers.yaml file to provide the runtime configuration for that controller, then activate the profile (for example, via SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=stress-controller or in application.yaml) so the controller is registered with the BifrostControllerManager and begins watching Stress CRs?
